A unique universe builder made with Three.js, React, and Typescript. The project does not aim to imitate a real-life universe; there's no gravity nor collision. It's all about creating star and planet constellations while also allowing for their customization. There are numerous customization optionsâ€”you can create stars, planets, moons, colorize them, add clouds, water, rings, and more.\

I plan on adding new features such as gas planets and biomes, but for now, I'm content with the current state of the project.

## Live version
The live / preview version is available: https://b0g3.github.io/PlanetGen3D/

## Additional notes
Unfortunately, this project is not perfect and could use some improvements. I plan on rewriting it, although it's not a top priority at the moment. Using Three Fiber instead of traditional Three.js with the complexity of this project proved to be a bit challenging. Additionally, I'm considering adding a state management library like Zustand or Redux to avoid using React contexts and to assist in managing infinitely nested states, such as celestials and their satellites.

Furthermore, I have plans to enhance the project by introducing new features, making the planets more unique with biomes, cliffs, rivers, and more. Apart from the stars and terrestrial planets, I also have plans for gas giants.

## Building the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
