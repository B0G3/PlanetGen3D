\
A unique universe builder made with Three.js, React, and Typescript. The project does not aim to imitate a real-life universe; there's no gravity nor collision. It's all about creating star and planet constellations while also allowing for their customization. There are numerous customization optionsâ€”you can create stars, planets, moons, colorize them, add clouds, water, rings, and more.\
\
I plan on adding new features such as gas planets and biomes, but for now, I'm content with the current state of the project.

## Building the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
